## Remarks
- Building animations using [AnimatedBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedBuilder-class.html)
- Controlling element visibility using both [Visibility](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Visibility-class.html) and `collection if`
- Creating custom widgets
- Creating custom color swatches. Further explanations can be found in [my article on Medium](https://medium.com/@filipvk/creating-a-custom-color-swatch-in-flutter-554bcdcb27f3) üçª
- Adding more than one [FloatingActionButton](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/FloatingActionButton-class.html)s in [Scaffold](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html). More like a hack tho.
- Responsive element & font sizes across different types of mobile devices
- Most efficient handling of application constants in Flutter
